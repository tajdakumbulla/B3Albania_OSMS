Online Shop Management System

This project is about creating and building a software, specifically a web-based application, that manages the activity within a perfumery. The software is called OSMS (Online Shop Management System). OSMS can be used both by the clients/costumers and staff. It covers different procedures from online ordering on the client site to inventory, products, price, orders management on staff site (admin or storekeeper).

 The client can make the orders and directly from a web browser also can check the status of its own order. This is a very efficient way of buying, as it saves time and money (going to the shop, finding a parking place which may cost). Basically, the app has a special user interface for costumers, manager, administrator.

Another task being managed by the app is sales management. The list of products are updated every time a new product is added. This list is accessible by the costumers, who can see the pries, product description and photo. The admin and manager can see the orders the status of the order, they could also see how many products are sold and ask the system for daily, monthly, yearly sales reports.  

The web application is built using Laravel Platform.
